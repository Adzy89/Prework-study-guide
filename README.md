# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built the prework study guide webpage to help other students along their journey into web development. This helps create clarity of what the basics are and it showcases what i have learnt along my journey. My mindset is understanding how things work, the thrill of breaking down the code and reassembling it is what drives me to understand more everytime.
